- This is a React SPA (Single Page Application).
- You can build the application using `pnpm run build`.
  - Please build as needed to confirm the validity of your work.
- You can run tests using `pnpm run test` (this executes `vitest`).
  - When planning, include tests within a reasonable scope (e.g., normal cases only, skip tests for complex mocking like clipboard/paste operations).
